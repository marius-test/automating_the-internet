# selenium_automation_testing

Built in Python using Selenium WebDriver and the unittest framework, this project focuses on practicing Selenium by working on challenging and complex functionalities with an emphasis on problem solving and testing.

For a complete Selenium framework implementation, see my other project: [selenium_automation_framework](https://github.com/marius-test/selenium_automation_framework).

Each site feature presents a challenge: how to locate elements, interact with them, and handle browser behavior, leading me to design multiple positive and negative test cases per functionality.

I chose **unittest** over `pytest` or `allure` to to keep the test design simple and focused.

I have also created a custom test runner, a debug file for troubleshooting, a test template for consistency, and a test debug file to aid in development.

I plan to develop a custom reporter and add more granular test control as the project evolves.

### Tech Stack

- **Python** - core programming language  
- **unittest** - testing framework  
- **Selenium WebDriver** - browser automation  
- **ChromeDriver** - main driver  
- **MSEdgeDriver** - alternative driver
- **Visual Studio Code** - main IDE  
- **PyCharm** - secondary IDE  
- **GitHub** - version control system

### Status

This project is currently **in progress** and continuously evolving as I automate more features and refine test design and structure.

# selenium_automation_testing

Target website: [https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/)

This project explores web automation challenges with a focus on problem-solving and test design, and it is built with **Python**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and the **unittest** framework.

Each feature pushes testing boundaries by requiring tricky element location, simulating user actions, or handling browser quirks, leading to both positive and negative test cases.

I chose `unittest` for its straightforward setup, native Python support, and a strong emphasis on writing clear, maintainable tests.

The project includes a custom test runner, driver factory, debug files, a reusable test template, reusable explicit waits, a custom reporter that generates clean HTML reports, and detailed documentation with instructions and commands.

Tests are organized in multiple modules covering sub-pages of the website. Each module targets specific functionalities, providing a robust foundation to expand coverage.

### Test Independence

Each test runs **independently** with its own WebDriver instance, created and managed by a shared driver factory. This setup provides:

- Isolation to prevent shared state or test interference  
- Flexibility to run tests in any order or in parallel  
- Simplified debugging by isolating failures  
- A trade-off of speed for improved reliability and robustness  

---

### Requirements and Setup

- Python 3.x  
- Dependencies managed via `requirements.txt`  
- See the documentation in the `docs/` folder at the root of the project for detailed setup and usage instructions.

### Handling Flaky Tests

The framework uses reusable explicit waits and safe waiting utilities to handle dynamic page elements and improve test stability.

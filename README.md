# automating_the-internet

This is my largest automation project so far, built in **Python** using **Selenium WebDriver** and the built-in **unittest** framework.

Each site feature presents a small challenge: how to locate elements, interact with them, and handle browser behavior, leading me to design multiple positive and negative test cases per functionality.

I chose **unittest** over `pytest` or `allure` to focus more on **OOP concepts**. I explore those tools in other projects.

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to write automated test cases for the website: [https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/)

This site includes **44 pages**, each with distinct elements and behaviors found on modern websites, perfect for practicing comprehensive test automation.

### Tech Stack

- **Python** - core programming language  
- **unittest** - testing framework  
- **Selenium WebDriver** - browser automation  
- **ChromeDriver** - main driver  
- **MSEdgeDriver** - alternative driver
- **Visual Studio Code** - main IDE  
- **PyCharm** - secondary IDE  
- **GitHub** - version control system

### Status

This project is currently **in progress** and continuously evolving as I automate more features and refine test design and structure.

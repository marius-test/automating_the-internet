# automating_the-internet

The goal of this project is to fully write automated test cases for the following website <https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/>.

This website has 44 pages with most of the functionalities found on a modern website.

The technology stack used for this project is the following:

- **Python** as the main programming language
- **unittest** and **pytest** as the testing framework
- **Selenium WebDriver** as the automation framework
- **chromedriver** as the main remote control interface
- **geckodriver** as the secondary remote control interface
- **Visual Studio Code** as the main integrated development environment
- **PyCharm** as the secondary integrated development environment
- **GitHub** as the version control system
- more than 5 years of software testing experience as a QA Engineer

By completing this project, I aim to understand the basics of **Automation Testing**.
